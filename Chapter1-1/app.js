// JavaScript is made of statements
// » Values: In Listing 1-1, 'Chris' is a value.
// » Expressions: Expressions are units of code that are evaluated and become
// values. For example, in Listing 1-1, the following is an expression:
// normalName + 'Script'
// When normalName has a value of 'Chris', this expression evaluates to
// 'ChrisScript'.
// » Operators: Operators do something with values. In Listing 1-1, the + operator
// (known as the concatenation operator) joins together the value of normalName
// and the literal value 'Script'.
// » Keywords: Keywords are parts of JavaScript that have special meaning and
// cause JavaScript to do something. In Listing 1-1, the word let is a keyword that
// tells JavaScript to store the value on the right side of the = .
